<b>Introduction</b>

A basic readme for the project RoboWars. Robowars is a unity based game that allows players to design and build their own robots using limited materials, and then fight them against npcs and other players. The twist is that rather than controlling the robot directly, all combat is autonomous, and players have to code the robots to fight entirely prior to the battle.

<b>Development</b>

The game is programmed in Unity with C#. While the game is in its extreem infancy right now, I hope that through my continued effort, and the effort of the community this game will come to fruition.

<b>How to play</b>

Arrow keys - Manipulate the view while in build mode.

S - Apply physics to objects with selected connectors.

C - Connect two or more selected connectors at the first connector selected.

A - Deselect all connectors

Mouse - Toggle selection on indevidual piece connectors.
